------

Toolkit for Audio (stricted to BGM) Dumping from their scramble filename in certain hassle way

It produce .awb with .acb respectively

You can use audio player (usually foobar2k) with VGMStream component to listen the audio

Version 0.0.0.1 Final (no pun intended, unless I fk up in certain case) and will be open source at Gitlab.

Using .Net Core 3.1 CLR with Portable Runtime, so you don't need to install .Net Core Runtime but file size quite big (sorry for that) unless you want to build from VS2019
